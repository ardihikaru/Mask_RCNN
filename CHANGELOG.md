  - Added automated epoch recognition for Windows. (#798)
  - Bugfix for MaskRCNN creating empty log_dir that breaks find_last() - Current implementation creates self.log_dir in set_log_dir() function,   which creates an empty log directory if none exists. This causes   find_last() to fail after creating a model because it finds this new   empty directory instead of the previous training directory. - New implementation moves log_dir creation to the train() function to   ensure it is only created when it will be used.
